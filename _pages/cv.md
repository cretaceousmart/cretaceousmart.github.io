Internship
======
**Hong Kong Baptist University Statistical department Zhuhai, China**
Research Assistant with Prof. Xiaoling Peng (R, MATLAB) 06/2020-06/2021
**Project 1:** Application of Representative Point in Goodness-of-fit Test
* Co-Supervised by Professor Kai-Tai Fang, (Fellowship of USA Statistical Association)
* Aimed to improve traditional model evaluation method using “Mean-Square-Error Representative Points”;
* The new method achieved state-of-the-art testing power (20% increased) compare with other Chi-square tests.
* Made several academic talks in seminar and submitted a SCI paper to Mathemetics (Q1 and top 10%)

**Project 2:** Face Image Generation and Style Transfer with Deep Learning. (Python: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas)
* Aimed to generate fake human face images by generative model and then apply the Style-Transfer algorithm.
* For face generation: Applied Generative Adversarial Network(Cycle-GAN, Style-GAN,W-GAN) and VAE.
* For Style Transfer: Applied Gaty’s method(2015), the performance is shown in my Tech-blog. 
* Used more than 200k images from CelebA dataset for model training and used IS & FID as evaluate criteria.


**Wu He Assets Foshan, China**
  Quantitative Research Department, Quantitative Researcher (R, Python, SQL, MongoDB) 07/2018-09/2018
  * Responsibility: Maintained the database of company, Mathematics modeling for asset price and Risk control.
  * Data management: Adopted Tushare(python library) to obtain the required data, and stored the data into the internal 
server of the company by using SQL and MongoDB.
  * Data Analysis: Use R and Python (Pandas/SciPy/NumPy) to implement Time series models (ARIMA, GARCH) and 
Machine learning models (RNN, LSTM).
  * Learn financial knowledge from. Financial Risk Manager(FRM) certificate.
  
  

Research
======
* ‘Which model is best?’ Relative goodness of fit testing with kernels, Post-graduation Thesis 3/2022-Present

   Supervised by Professor Francois-Xavier Briol, leader of Allen Turing Institute
  * Based on Kernel Stein Distance(KSD) and Parametric bootstrap, extend the existing kernel-based relative test.
  * Enable the model choose a property parametric family.
  * Implementing the tests and evaluating their performance on a selection of model families.
  * Found great improvement and prepare to submit a paper to NIPS2023

* Application of Representative Point in Goodness-of-fit Test, Graduation Thesis 06/2020-06/2021

  Supervised by Professor Kai-Tai Fang, an internationally renowned statistician and the “Father of Uniform Design”
  * Aimed to improve traditional goodness-of-fit test method using “MSE-representative point”;
  * Compiled programming via MATLAB and make several academic lecture in seminar.
  * Found great improvement and submitted a paper to Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation

* Application of Machine Learning in Epilepsy Detection 05/2021-Present

  Personal Project as research assistant in United International College
  * Aimed to classify the epileptic condition and predict the seizures time according to their brainwave data (EEG);
  * Applied some signal processing methods (Fourier transform and Wavelet Transform) and some denoising techniques in data pre-processing, then the CNN and LSTM in feature       extraction, and adopted the Dynamic Convolution Neural Network to improve algorithm efficiency using python and related packages such as Pytorch and MNE.

* The Style Transfer in Deep Learning Realized through CNN and GANs 12/2020
  
  Personal Project for the course of Introduction to Deep Learning through Python (Mark A)
  * Aimed to transfer the style feature from one image to another while contain the original content feature;
  * Made a literature review and comparison for several main algorithm of Style transfer from Gaty’s method(2015) to Cycle-GANs(2018), and implemented each method by Pytorch;
  * Transferred the style of Van Gogh to some photos of my school, which was well received by teachers and classmates
