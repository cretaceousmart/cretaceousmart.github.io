Research
======
* ‘Which model is best?’ Relative goodness of fit testing with kernels, Post-graduation Thesis 01/2021-Now 

   Supervised by Francois-Xavier Brio, an young but internationally renowned computer scientist
  * Extend the existing kernel-based relative goodness-of-fit tests to the composite problem. 
  * Implementing the tests and evaluating their performance on a selection of model families.
  * Found great improvement and prepare to submit a paper to NIPS2022

* Application of Representative Point in Goodness-of-fit Test, Graduation Thesis 06/2020-06/2021

  Supervised by Professor Kai-Tai Fang, an internationally renowned statistician and the “Father of Uniform Design”
  * Aimed to improve traditional goodness-of-fit test method using “MSE-representative point”;
  * Compiled programming via MATLAB and make several academic lecture in seminar.
  * Found great improvement and submitted a paper to Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation

* Application of Machine Learning in Epilepsy Detection 05/2021-Present

  Personal Project as research assistant in United International College
  * Aimed to classify the epileptic condition and predict the seizures time according to their brainwave data (EEG);
  * Applied some signal processing methods (Fourier transform and Wavelet Transform) and some denoising techniques in data pre-processing, then the CNN and LSTM in feature       extraction, and adopted the Dynamic Convolution Neural Network to improve algorithm efficiency using python and related packages such as Pytorch and MNE.

* The Style Transfer in Deep Learning Realized through CNN and GANs 12/2020
  
  Personal Project for the course of Introduction to Deep Learning through Python (Mark A)
  * Aimed to transfer the style feature from one image to another while contain the original content feature;
  * Made a literature review and comparison for several main algorithm of Style transfer from Gaty’s method(2015) to Cycle-GANs(2018), and implemented each method by Pytorch;
  * Transferred the style of Van Gogh to some photos of my school, which was well received by teachers and classmates
