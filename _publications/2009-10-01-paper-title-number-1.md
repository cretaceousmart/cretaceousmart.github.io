The classical Pearson-Fisher chi-square test is a general approach to testing goodness-of-fit for univariate data. There is a considerable amount of discussion on how to effectively apply this test to practical goodness-of-fit problems in the literature. There are two major types of discussions: the number of grouping intervals and the selection of grouping intervals. In this paper, we apply the idea of representative points (RP) of statistical distributions to the selection of grouping intervals for the classical Pearson-Fisher chi-square test. We focus on the location-scale distributions due to their simple distributional structure. Special attention is paid to the three types of location-scale distributions: normal, Laplace, and the logistic distributions. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the RP-aided Pearson-Fisher test outperforms the traditional equiprobable Pearson-Fisher test in most cases under study. Some examples with real data are illustrated for practical application.
